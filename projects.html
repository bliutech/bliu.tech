          An ongoing area of research involves defenses against adversarial
          examples, which are specifically designed inputs that attack the
          model's inference. We explore the impact on adversarial examples
          against common deep learning classification architectures such as CNNs
          and RNNs, specifically testing on a CNN and CNN-LSTM hybrid, trained
          on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We implemented an efficient adversarial
          attack known as the Fast-Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate
          perturbations against the baseline model. We then developed more
          robust networks specifically to defend against adversarial attacks by
          performing data augmentation on the original dataset with adversarial
          examples. We then trained our improved networks on this dataset. Our
          baseline models had a 80.374% accuracy for the CNN and 79.001% for the
          CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture, and when attacked with adversarial
          examples with \(\epsilon = 0.1\), their accuracies dropped to 9.375%
          and 12.679%, respectively. In comparison, our robust models trained on
          examples with \(\epsilon = 0.2\) defended well against these attacks,
          achieving a validation accuracy of 75.488% for the CNN architecture
          and 74.056% for the CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture, which is an absolute
          increase of 64.142% for the CNN architecture and 61.375% for the
          CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture, respectively. When comparing
          architectures, although there were strengths to the CNN-LSTM hybrid
          architecture, the CNN outperformed it in terms of accuracy and
          training time for adversarial examples.

          The threat presented by malware hidden in Portable Document Formats
          (PDFs) is a serious issue to the average Internet user, with the
          ability of a PDF to execute purposefully-embedded JavaScript serving
          as a method of obscuring malicious scripts and data. While there are
          several existing Machine Learning-based models designed for PDF
          malware detection, the usage of transformers to statically analyze
          PDFs for malware has not yet been explored. Due to their attention
          mechanisms and ability to process data in parallel, transformers hold
          great potential for analyzing large quantities of data in detail
          without being excessively computationally demanding. By preprocessing
          PDFs as byte strings, generating meaningful word embeddings using
          one-hot encoding and variable n-grams, and feeding these results to a
          fine-tuned transformer model, we have produced a model that classifies
          a testing set of PDFs as malicious or benign with 96.67% accuracy.
          After evaluating the performance of our model, we can note that this
          is a feasible method of performing robust static analysis on PDF
          files. However, it is important to continue refining the current model
          and exploring additional methods of improving the accuracy and
          precision of the model on a varied dataset.

          OrganSafe is a revolutionary web application that tackles the growing
          health & security problem of black marketing of donated organs. The
          verification of organ recipients leverages the Ethereum Blockchain to
          provide critical security and prevent improper allocation for such a
          pivotal resource. Users can also register on OrganSafe with their
          health information and desired donation and then application's
          algorithms will automatically match the users based on qualifying
          priority for available donations. Hospitals can easily track donations
          of organs and easily record when recipients receive their donation.

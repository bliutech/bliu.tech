## Local Development

For local development with HTML & CSS, it is recommended to install [`serve`](https://github.com/bliutech/bliu.tech) as a useful tool.

cd bliu.tech/
npx serve
```

For linting, it is recommended to install [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) as a useful tool.

```
